  I was looking for some new front end technologies to learn and recently found
  out about Gatsby and decided to give this tech a try by building this blog
  project. Under the hood, this is project is made with react, typescript,
  emotion (css-in-js) and a bunch of gatsby plugins. My initial impression of
  Gatsby is daaaammnnn... this thing is very powerful and i'm looking to know
  more about it! Stay tuned for future projects! ðŸ˜Ž

  The code for this project can be found{' '}
  <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/inThaHouse/practice_blog'>
    here

Or.

<ButtonLink
  path='blog'
  primaryColor={'white'}
  secondaryColor={'black'}
  buttonText={'Visit The Blog!'}
/>
