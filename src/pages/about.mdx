  I was looking for some new front end technologies to learn and recently found
  out about Gatsby and decided to give this tech a try by building this blog
  project. Under the hood, this is project is made with react, typescript,
  emotion (css-in-js), client side graphql and a bunch of gatsby plugins.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  My initial impression of Gatsby is daaaammnnn... this thing is very powerful
  and i'm looking to know more about it! There is some amount of learning curve
  like understanding the plugin system and how to compose and much much more!.
  Stay tuned for future projects! ðŸ˜Ž

<p>
  The code for this project can be found{' '}
  <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/inThaHouse/practice_blog'>
    here
  </a>
  .
</p>

Or.

<ButtonLink
  path='blog'
  primaryColor={Colors.WHITE}
  secondaryColor={Colors.BLACK}
  buttonText={'Visit The Blog!'}
/>
