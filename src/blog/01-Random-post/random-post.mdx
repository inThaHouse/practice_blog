Marry me. Guyâ€™s a pro.

<p>
  Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, youâ€™ll have more
  fun. Whoa, this guyâ€™s straight? Itâ€™s a hug, Michael. Iâ€™m hugging you. Well,
  what do you expect, mother? Iâ€™m afraid I just blue myself.
  <br />
  <br /> Guyâ€™s a pro. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. I donâ€™t
  criticize you! And if youâ€™re worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the
  best defense. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough. Itâ€™s
  called â€˜taking advantage. <br />
  <br /> Itâ€™s what gets you ahead in life. Iâ€™ve opened a door here that I regret.
