Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! You hit me with a cricket bat. Annihilate?

<p>
  I’m nobody’s taxi service; I’m not gonna be there to catch you every time you
  feel like jumping out of a spaceship. Sorry, checking all the water in this
  area; there’s an escaped fish. It’s art! A statement on modern society, ‘Oh
  Ain’t Modern Society Awful?’!

  It’s art! A statement on modern society, ‘Oh Ain’t Modern Society Awful?’! Did
  I mention we have comfy chairs? Did I mention we have comfy chairs? All I’ve got
  to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?

  No. No violence. I won’t stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand
  me?! I’m the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm – and you basically meant beat them in
  a football match, didn’t you?
